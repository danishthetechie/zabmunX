								It can be stated without a doubt that the ZABMUN Training Programme has 
								gained a lot of popularity since last year, attracting a huge number of delegates. 
								The ZTP acts as the core of ZABMUN in terms of academics. This team will be hand-picked 
								by our Secretary General and Academic Curator who further supervise the department. 
								This department has two core jobs- to train delegates & handle the academics. All study 
								guides will be created with this team, ensuring that the academic quality is maintained. 
								ZTP's Model UN Training Programme shall be a yearround unconditional coaching service 
								designed to provide all interested schools, colleges and institutes dedicated training 
								and support for Model UNs with a curated set of modules and workshops aimed at improving 
								overall delegate performance. This academically enriched relationship will be "paid" 
								solely by the participating institute's pledge to participate in ZABMUN. The ZTP intends 
								to accredit every participating institute on the basis of their performance evaluations 
								and experience at the training regimen to further align ZABMUN Society's actions with values 
								of academic prowess and an authority of greater learning in the Model UN circuit at home 
								and around the world

								After the schools and private delegates will complete the registration process, 
								they will be able to access the ZTP option on the ZABMUN official website. 
								Through this they will apply for the training programme and our team will 
								schedule a date for their school. For the individual or private delegates, 
								we will conduct a session at ZABMUN and train these delegates together. In the next 
								3 months, we will keep at least 4 mock sessions where actual UN committees will be 
								simulated so that the delegates can be well-prepared for the actual conference. All 
								the candidates registered for ZABMUN will be able to attend these sessions. This session 
								will also be open for SZABIST Students.

								After the committees and topics will be released, we will assign the ZTP members the 
								committees in which they have command over. The names and contacts of these ZTP members 
								will be provided on the ZABMUN website under their specified committees. Through this 
								the delegates will get personalized training through Skype, calls or texts. ZTP will 
								help increase the overall delegate count. It is an innovative way to market ZABMUN and 
								also ensure full satisfaction from our delegates. It will achieve loyalty from institutes 
								to ZABMUN. ZTP will help in reformulating the MUN Culture, showing that we prioritize 
								academics over commercialization. Evaluation of ZTP members will be conducted each month 
								and they will also be providing the detailed academic reports of their progress.

								During the conference, the trained ZTP members will act as ACDâ€™s and will be 
								instructed to take notes on the debate flow in the committee and keep records 
								of the flow of debate and will be responsible for submitting daily reports to 
								the Academic Curator/Director ZTP via email. All the documents generated during 
								ZABMUN will be run through plagiarism software to ensure the academic quality 
								remains sound and unfair advantages are not availed.<br> 
								Additionally, the members will keep rotating between committee sessions to ensure 
								the smooth flow of debate. Team ZTP will also act as the core ZABMUN Debate Team 
								for the whole year to inculcate the debating culture within the institution.
