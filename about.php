								ZABMUN was initiated 11 years ago as SZABIST introduced student activities to further the university 
								experience of its students and attempted to inculcate the values of leadership, as well as promote 
								discourse and debate. What started as a student organization in 2007, has since then grown and become 
								an MUN legacy. ZABMUN has set the bar in the academic quality of MUN conferences all across the country.

								<p>ZABMUN believes in elevating the status of the youth by organizing social 
								development programs for under-privileged children.  As socially responsible 
								citizens, it is our duty to contribute and create a positive impact on the society. 
								ZSR aims to envision a community of leaders that will not only create a powerful impact, 
								but also identify and present solutions for the prosperous of the society, locally and globally.<br>
								MUN Karachi was launched in 2014 as the first CSR project by ZABMUN, and was sponsored by 
								Karachi Youth Initiative. Around 100 schools, in areas like Malir and Lyari, were approached by 
								team ZABMUN, and the students were invited to SZABIST University for Model U.N. training, during 
								which the students were formed into delegations and each delegation was guided by a mentor.<br>
								The training was followed by MUN Karachi, a 3 day Model U.N. conference, where the winners gained an 
								automatic entry to the ZABMUN VII conference. Social events for MUN Karachi included ‘Global Village’, 
								where the delegates displayed their countries, and ‘Movie Screening’, where the screening for ‘Zinda Bhaag’ 
								was arranged for the participants.</p>

							<p>NASRAMUN is also a social responsibility project of ZABMUN initiated in 2015 that has been 
							successfully executed for the past two years as a joint venture with Education Trust Nasra School. 
							NASRAMUN hosted 640 delegates with 23 committees simulated in 2015, and last year had an estimate 
							of around 1000 delegates. The collaboration was to introduce the idea of stimulated debates in the 
							students of Nasra School, to inculcate the art of diplomacy, and to foster leadership. ZABMUN’S 
							social responsibility program plans to hold several Community Development Projects throughout the 
							year in collaboration with different NGOs and Organizations. These projects will aim to go beyond 
							the concept of Model UN and initiate a diverse range of personal development training programs. 
							ZABMUN aims to keep investing in the youth of Pakistan to give them a complete experience of 
							public speaking, and teaching them the art of diplomacy!</p>

							<p>On Sunday, July 22nd, team ZABMUN collaborated with Seed Ball Pakistan, 
							an emerging NGO committed to making tree plantation in the country efficient, 
							effective and easier. Together, we tirelessly worked to make the environment greener 
							while promising a sustainable future for generations to come. Inspired by their mission 
							and their close proximity to ZABMUN’s ideals, we had the honor of inviting them at SZABIST 
							to learn more and offer our collaboration.</p>

							<p>Through a successful collaboration, members of ZABMUN actively participated with Seed Ball-Pakistan 
							to plant 700+ seed balls at two carefully picked locations in Karachi. The first destination was a 
							public school in Landhi by the name of Muhammad Ali Jinnah Primary School (Campus-3), and the second 
							destination being a family park next to Karachi Metropolitan Library, Clifton.<br>
							From the 27th of September to date, ZABMUN has been paying weekly visits to underprivileged schools in 
							order to inculcate within these students the art of leadership, dialogue and diplomacy. These students are 
							being coached consecutively by our core ZABMUN TRAINING PROGRAMME through proper training and support for 
							Model UNs with a curated set of modules and workshops aimed at improving their performance. <br>These teams are 
							also being awarded with a chance to attend ZABMUN X conference for free. Moreover, ZABMUN also planned a 
							sports event at these school where the winners won free passes to ZABMUN. <br>The schools we targeted were 
							Bright House Grammar School and Rising Star School.</p>
